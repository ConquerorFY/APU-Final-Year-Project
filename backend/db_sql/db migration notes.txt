When trying to migrate MySQL database to another device, make sure to not directly create DB and import the SQL file
Instead, try to create the DB, run migrations (manage.py migrate) and then only import the SQL file

This is to avoid issues such as ValueError('The database backend does not accept 0 as a value for AutoField') from occuring
